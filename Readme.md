This project is based on an Optional Activity discussed by Professor in class,
In this project I created a  YAML to XLSX converter, which converts a .yaml file into .xlsx sheet format and also creates a Readme.md for that.


Libraries used :-openpyxl yaml

Run this command in terminal -> pip install openpyxl yaml
